Description: Create data summaries for clinical studies and basic statistical analysis.
    Display statistics (number of valid observations, mean, median, standard deviation, 
    IQR, etc.) as well as the p-values from ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis for multiple 
    comparisons. Perform post-hoc comparison test results with different adjustment methods.
    Create box-plots and bar charts for either single or double predictors with user-defined
    (parametric or non-parametric) p-values from appropriate tests.
